# Armstrong Number :- 
An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1\^3 + 5\^3 + 3\^3 = 153\). 
In general, for a number with n digits, if you take each digit, raise it to the power of n, and sum them, the result should equal the original number for it to be classified as an Armstrong number.
